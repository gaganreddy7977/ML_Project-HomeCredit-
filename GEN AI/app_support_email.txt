Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to the IT Support Team. We understand that you are experiencing an error while attempting to log in to your account. 

To resolve this issue, please follow these step-by-step troubleshooting instructions:

**Step 1: Verify Your Credentials**
Ensure that you are entering your full Edukron email address and that your **Caps Lock** is turned off. Sometimes, extra spaces at the beginning or end of the password field can cause a login failure.

**Step 2: Clear Your Browser Cache and Cookies**
Stored data in your browser can sometimes interfere with the login process.
*   Go to your browser settings.
*   Find "Privacy and Security."
*   Select **Clear Browsing Data** (ensure "Cookies" and "Cached images and files" are selected).
*   Restart your browser and try logging in again.

**Step 3: Use an Incognito/Private Window**
To rule out any browser extensions or plugins causing the error:
*   Open a new **Incognito** (Chrome) or **Private** (Firefox/Safari) window.
*   Navigate to the login page and attempt to sign in.

**Step 4: Perform a Password Reset**
If the error message indicates "Invalid Credentials," please reset your password:
*   Click on the **"Forgot Password?"** link on the login page.
*   Enter your registered email address to receive a reset link.
*   Follow the instructions in the email to create a new password and try logging in again.

**Step 5: Check Your Internet Connection/VPN**
Ensure you have a stable internet connection. If you are working remotely, please try disconnecting and reconnecting your VPN, as this can sometimes refresh your authentication token.
